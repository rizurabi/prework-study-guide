      <li>Property value, to the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property</li>
      <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})</li>
      <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
